# cshaver's Atom settings

Atom is great.

## Installation

You should probably fork this repo so you can sync your own atom settings across machines. This is a good starting point but I doubt you'll keep your settings exactly like mine. :)

Clone this repo and symlink it to your atom config folder.

Be sure you have Package Sync installed:
`apm install package-sync`

Command palette:

`CMD + Shift + P -> Package Sync: Sync`

Or through the menu:

`Packages -> Package Sync -> Sync Packages`

This will install the packages listed in `packages.cson`.
